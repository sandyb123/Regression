Rooted in the sacred geometry of the Golden Ratio, ABH creates prestige cosmetics for a passionate prosumer audience.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;Soare was first to introduce brow shaping and products based on her patented Golden Ratio Eyebrow Shaping Method, and is widely credited for fueling the multi-million dollar business that surrounds the category. Popularized through customer relationships with some of the world’s most recognizable faces, the “brow revolution” she ignited has become a landmark contribution to beauty history. In 2014, ABH debuted its new color makeup line on Instagram, cultivating a relationship with customers focused on product education, artistry, and responsiveness in delivering the “ultimate polished look” for which the brand is known. ABH has received industry-wide recognition for digital innovation and numerous accolades for products such as cult-classics Brow Wiz, Contour Kit, and Liquid Lipstick.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;ABH products are available at anastasiabeverlyhills.com, Dillard’s, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Sephora, ULTA, and select retailers in over 25 countries. ABH is committed to cruelty-free product formulation, testing, and development.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;CEO, ANASTASIA SOARE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;Beauty pioneer, creative visionary and powerhouse entrepreneur Anastasia Soare is Founder, CEO, and driving force behind Anastasia Beverly Hills—one of the fastest-growing brands in the global beauty industry. Soare immigrated to the US from Romania\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without language skills or financial means; instead she leveraged a fierce resolve and education in art and architecture to fuel her entrepreneurial vision and unique approach to beauty. In 1990, she introduced a new “brow-shaping” service to clients—later\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patented as the “Golden Ratio” method—that has gone on to become a staple service and enduring new category in modern beauty. Soare continues to push boundaries today, expanding beyond&amp;nbsp;the brow category with the company’s leading prestige cosmetics\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line. Her capacity for driving growth through innovation and organizational focus on customers has become a hallmark of her leadership and the ABH brand. Soare’s gift as artist and entrepreneur is complemented by an ease and grace with customers with\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whom she connects daily in video tutorials and personal appearances around the world. Her audience spans the globe and comprises many of its most famous faces, who rely on her unique vision of individual beauty to amplify their own.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;Soare has achieved iconic status in her twenty-five year journey to self-made entrepreneur and American success story. She has been featured in The New York Times, The Guardian, People, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Elle, and Allure, among numerous other publications,\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and has appeared on such television shows as The Doctor Oz Show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and America’s Next Top Model. Soare&apos;s belief in beauty’s power to transform extends to her lifelong work for women and children and the establishment of The Anastasia\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brighter Horizon Foundation, which supports and advances the lives of young adults exiting the foster care system.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PRESIDENT, CLAUDIA SOARE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;Anastasia Beverly Hills President Claudia Soare leads the company’s day-to-day operations, product development, and marketing for the brand’s best-selling prestige cosmetics line. As the daughter of ABH Founder Anastasia Soare, there may be no better-suited\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executive, given her own voracious entrepreneurial spirit and hands-on experience through the years, working in every layer of the organization from receptionist to salesperson to product tester. A radical entrepreneur in her own right, Soare has\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been credited with leadership decisions that have catapulted ABH to its standing among the world’s most influential cosmetics brands. As an early adopter of social media platforms, Soare has made an art out of knowing her customer—a bold, self-regulating\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approach to customer retention where products are tested and reported on in real-time by millions of captivated followers who demand top-performing formulas and visionary trends. In industry-unique positioning, Soare puts herself forward as the brand’s\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first line of engagement, working directly with ABH followers and influencers to introduce state-of-the-art, industry-defining products direct to consumer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;“Anastasia Beverly Hills is the crowning achievement of my mother’s extraordinary vision as an artist and entrepreneur. My task is to align that vision with the dynamic voice of our customer—we’re a winning team.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANASTASIA&apos;S GOLDEN RATIO® METHOD&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Our eyes are intrinsically trained to spot divine proportion and immediately associate it with beauty and harmony.” – Anastasia Soare&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;It’s been well-documented over the millennia by groundbreaking thinkers—including Pythagoras, Leonardo Da Vinci, and Albert Einstein—that the human eye is encoded to recognize nature’s universal design fractal: The Golden Ratio. This mathematical ratio\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of 1.618 to 1—in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts—offers the key to finding balance, symmetry, and beauty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;Inspired by this age-old ratio, Anastasia created a unique and breakthrough method of shaping brows. By following these principles, she could create a set of arches that perfectly framed and suited any face shape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Brows should begin directly above the middle of your nostrils. The highest point of the arch should connect the tip of the nose with the middle of the iris. Brows should end where the corner of the nostril connects with the outer corner of the eye,” Anastasia says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;This patented Golden Ratio® method remains at the heart of Anastasia Beverly Hills. Each product launch is inspired by makeup’s unique ability to create the illusion of facial balance, symmetry, and proportion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&nbsp; &lt;p style=\&quot;text-align: justify;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&quot;,&quot;c_customCSSFile&quot;:&quot;https://development-abh-anastasiabeverlyhills.demandware.net/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-AnastasiaSharedLibrary/default/v1550668694882/css/aboutus.css&quot;}<br />
